# Shame Partials

These shame partials should only be the ones that will be used in your global
styles library for use on all pages of the site.

Shame partials are a place to put kludges and workarounds that you would prefer
not to do, and which you may refactor later. Sometimes to get a project done you
need to do something the "wrong" way to move forward, with the hope that there
will be time to reduce technical debt later. Place that in a shame partial so
you can easily find it later and then move on.

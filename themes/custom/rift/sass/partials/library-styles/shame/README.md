# Shame Partials

These shame partials should be those which are used with elements that do not
appear on all pages of the site. These partials should be loaded in a library
style file at the root of the sass directory.

Shame partials are a place to put kludges and workarounds that you would prefer
not to do, and which you may refactor later. Sometimes to get a project done you
need to do something the "wrong" way to move forward, with the hope that there
will be time to reduce technical debt later. Place that in a shame partial so
you can easily find it later and then move on.

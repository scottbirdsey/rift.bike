// Mixins
//
// Pulls in custom mixins from partials for ease of use.
//
// Mixins should be the primary way to duplicate rules between multiple
// components, with the added bonus of being able to vary those rules through
// the use of arguments. Avoid using extends to share rules as that causes
// inconsistencies with where the styles appear within the compiled CSS. Gzip
// generally minimizes any increases in file size from duplication of rules
// between components with mixins.

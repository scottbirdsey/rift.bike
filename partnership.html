			<h1>Partnership</h1>
			<p>Oh, hey! You’ve made your way to me. I have so much I want to tell you.</p>
			<p>RIFT &#9658; is a limited-run, boutique-level cycling apparel brand, with a one-man racing squad (me!) serving as a marketing arm. A full schedule of Elite-level road, XC, and CX are all on the menu, concluding with a run at the 2018 Cyclocross Nationals race in Louisville. This is, needless to say, an exciting time for me, both in my design and racing careers, and I would love nothing more than to share it with <em>you</em>.</p>

			<h2>About Rift</h2>
			<p>This label is Bauhaus meets Bart Simpson. It will make references to the past – both pop-culture and bike racing culture. It will disrupt the notion of nostalgia and explore how hypnogogia can have a place in apparel design. I will initially be focusing on producing apparel accessories, rather than full-on kits, because a large part of my initial market will be cyclists who ride in clubs or on teams. Eventually there will be a full line of offerings though - a la <a href="http://godandfamo.us">God &amp; Famous</a>.</p>

			<h2>On the Subject of Me</h2>
			<p>I am a 32-year-old web designer that used to obsessively draw hockey team logos in grade school. I have spent my life as a DJ, hobo guitar player, LES party person, barista slacker, dirtbike-riding loner, and vintage moped gang founder. I've always been creative and enjoyed making things. When I stumbled into cycling a few years ago, my life changed enormously for the better. Once I realized that cycling was not a sport, but a culture, I was sold for good. Since then, I've raced two full years of road and cyclocross, won two state championships, joined the board of my local cycling club, and become the creative director of the leading cyclocross series in New York. With Rift, I am paying my dues to a culture that has largely impacted my life for the best.</p>

			<h2>I Want to Market You</h2>
			<p>The concept of sponsorship to me is concrete to me. I have worked in a marketing department for ten years, and so the concept of myself marketing your brand is one that is comfortable and clear. I am open and interested in the traditional ways that this is done: logo placement on racing kit, social media shoutouts (I use IG), "p/b" race team naming, and general brand evangelism. To this end, I am only working with brands that I feel an affinity with – I am not interested in faking support for something I do not sincerely feel. So – if we work together, expect some real love and support..

			<h2>How You Can Help Me</h2>
			<p>Man, racing is expensive, right? I need gear and money to pay my race fees. It isn’t really any more complicated than that.</p>
